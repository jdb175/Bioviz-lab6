# Lab 5: Force-Directed Layouts

My initial strategy for setting the values was to just copy the [force-directed graph tutorial](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045), which had a more distributed appearance than the reference. In particular the large center-right group was much less pronounced. Decreasing the charge value improved it somewhat, although tweaking never really game

Based on Jordan's suggestion I added the ability to pin nodes, which can be done by double-clicking them. This allowed me to massage the graph to be a little more similar to the one in the reference.
